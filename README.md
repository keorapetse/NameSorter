# NameSorter

## What it does
This is a console app that sorts a list of names.  
It sorts by **last name first**, then by given names.  

It prints the sorted names to the screen and saves them to a file called `sorted-names-list.txt`.

## How to run

From the command line:
dotnet run --project NameSorter.App ./unsorted-names-list.txt
